         <p>This document is a simplified "true-to-text" XML version of <title>The Spanish Curate</title> based on Pennsylvania State University's annotated copy of the 1647
            Beaumont &amp; Fletcher first folio. Major textual elements and attributes have been captured based on how they appear in the folio. Whenever possible, editorial
            interventions have been minimalized or avoided entirely. This document is meant to serve as a pedagogical tool by which students of Early Modern literature can learn
            to construct edited XML versions of the play.</p>

               The Digital Beaumont &amp; Fletcher (1647) is a collaborative editorial project aimed at making many of the rarely edited—and, as a result, rarely taught—plays in the
               “Beaumont &amp; Fletcher” canon accessible to student readers and freely available online for classroom use. This project was inspired by the distinctive copy of Comedies
               and Tragedies Written by Francis Beavmont And Iohn Fletcher Gentlemen (1647) held by Penn State University's Eberly Family Special Collections Library. In addition to
               preserving evidence of ownership dating to as early as 1703, Penn State's copy of this printed play collection also includes three plays with handwritten marginalia,
               suggesting that the book might have been used to facilitate performance in the late seventeenth century. This project is also motivated by a desire to make the texts and
               other features of this book more widely known and readable. As a first step, the whole volume has now been fully digitized, thanks to the department of Preservation,
               Conservation, and Digitization at Penn State Libraries.

                  This edition of The Spanish Curate contains the marginal notes found in the Penn State Libraries' copy of the 1647 folio. These manuscript notes are particually attentive to
                  the performance of the play, and prepare actors for entrances and emphasize stage directions throughout the text. These manuscript notes have been added to the text without modernization
                  spelling of puncuation.
